# Datatype-Generic Programming Meets Elaborator Reflection

This is a port of the [code](https://github.com/Zekt/Type-Embellishment) from the paper [Datatype-generic programming meets elaborator reflection](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3547629), with the following modifications:
- The custom prelude has been replaced with a dependency on the Agda standard library.
- Anything irrelevant to the *use* of the library has been stripped out (i.e. code that may matter to a reader of the paper but is not likely to matter to a user of the library).

This is a work-in-progress; the claims above are not true yet.
